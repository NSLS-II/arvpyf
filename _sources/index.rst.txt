Archiver Python Frontend 
=========================

Archiver Python Frontend represents a collection of Python classes
associated with the `EPICS Archiver Appliance 
<https://slacmshankar.github.io/epicsarchiver_docs/>`_ middle 
layer and other data sources for building composite and extandable 
applications and integrating them with general (like `Apache Spark
<https://spark.apache.org/>`_) or domain-wide (like `NSLS-II Databroker
<http://nsls-ii.github.io/databroker/>`_) data management and processing 
systems. 

The current version combines the Python classes for extending 
the scope of the Archiver Appliance WebUI interface with the
scalable configuration approach for registering the EPICS 
process variables (PVs) using the EPICS Archiver Appliance MGMT
service.
